			Hi Baby today is your 17th birthday <b style = "color: yellow;">WOHOO!</b>
			Today is a special day because it marks the 17<sup>th</sup> year you have been alive.
			And I am glad you have been alive for 17 years because I don't think I would be alive for
			one year without you baby. And I know today is your birthday and I probably will end up being a 
			poopie some how but I apologize in advance if I am a poopie face today. Today is your day and
			whatever you want just ask for it. I will gladly keep you happy today. Oh and since today is your birthday
			you will be getting presents <b style = "color: yellow;">YAY!!!</b> I'm sorry if I didn't get you something that you 
			really wanted. I will get you it eventually. I hope today is a good day for my boobear.<br> 
			<b style = "color: red;">I love you with all of my heart baby forever and ever&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;</b>
